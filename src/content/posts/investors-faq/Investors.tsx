        Welcome to the Fund, where we turn market inefficiencies into systematic alpha while always prioritizing risk-adjusted returns, free cash flow excellence, and absolute long-term compounding. Below, we break down everything an investor at Charlie Munger’s level would ask—no fluff, just straight talk.

          </Heading>
          <Text mb={2}>
            The Fund executes a highly disciplined “Sell The Wall” strategy—an AI-powered options premium harvesting model that maximizes rental income from the most capital-efficient, free cash flow-generating businesses in the world.

              We sell calls at peak exuberance and puts at deep value accumulation levels to capture premium without taking excessive risk.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              The strategy works in all market conditions because it is not dependent on market direction—it thrives on volatility and market mispricings.

              Our portfolio focuses on SPX10-level companies, ensuring deep liquidity, optimal price discovery, and sustainable earnings power.

            In plain English: We rent volatility, let markets overreact, and collect weekly and monthly income while owning the best assets at the lowest prices.

            <ListItem>
              Capital Efficiency – Avoid over-capitalized, low-return AI hype plays; prefer disciplined operators (e.g., AAPL, NVDA, MSFT).
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              Risk as a Function of Return – If risk-adjusted alpha isn’t positive, we do not play.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              The Munger-Buffett Rule – We do not chase; we let the best businesses come to us at the best price possible through disciplined risk management.

            Our fund is designed to maximize sustainable rental income while preserving long-term compounding potential.

          <UnorderedList pl={4} spacing={2}>
            <ListItem>
              Selling Volatility as a Business: We structure trades to capitalize on investor fear and greed, selling options at peak implied volatility moments and covering risk at optimal statistical levels.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              Owning Free Cash Flow Machines at a Discount: Through systematic put selling, we acquire world-class assets at a discount to intrinsic value.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              Leveraging AI-Driven Market Data: We continuously improve entry/exit points, risk management models, and capital allocation using real-time AI analytics.
            </ListItem>
          </UnorderedList>
          <Text mt={2}>
            Bottom line: We make money because markets are emotional, inefficient, and predictable. We execute without emotion and let the system do the work.

              Our maximum drawdown is designed to be SPX +/- 15%, reflecting our heavy concentration in SPX10-level businesses.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              Cash Management Discipline: We maintain high cash reserves (currently $4.446M) to deploy tactically and manage liquidity risk.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              No Overleveraging: We use margin only when risk/reward is in our favor and ensure borrowing costs never exceed rental income from options premiums.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              Real-Time Hedging: AI-driven hedging ensures we adjust to macro risks without being reactive.

          </Heading>
          <UnorderedList pl={4} spacing={2}>
            <ListItem>
              Our base case is a 12-15% annualized return, primarily from options premium collection.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              In bull markets, we make money from options premium plus capital appreciation.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              In bear markets, we continue to sell premium and acquire assets at the best price.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              During volatility spikes, our returns expand because fear pricing results in higher premiums.
            </ListItem>
          </UnorderedList>
          <Text mt={2}>
            It is about compounding, not gambling. A 12-15% return may sound modest to some, but over 20 years, it turns $1M into $10M or more.

              Google recently spent $75B in capital expenditures, while AAPL, NVDA, and MSFT maintained leaner operations.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              Question: Will AI spending result in real cash flow, or merely an arms race?
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              Answer: The market remains unconvinced—GOOGL dropped 9% post-earnings for a reason.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              Verdict: We are in a wait-and-see mode while continuing to monetize market panic via options premium.
            </ListItem>
          </UnorderedList>
          <Text mt={2}>
            The AI race is exciting, but free cash flow always wins in the long run. If AI capital expenditures do not produce significant ROI, it is simply wasted dollars.
