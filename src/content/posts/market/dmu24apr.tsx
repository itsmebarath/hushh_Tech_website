        We let the aloha program do its thing again with some tweaks to keep our largest positions in delta neutral state until we see clear bulls back in control. I personally expect choppy waters for a while but I'm i think a minority in that camp. 🏕

        I expect to take some short term losses to reduce our margin and get back to healthy levels of margin for my liking - that being said we are still within the guidelines and risk controls; happy to discuss the same with anyone interested.
