        <List spacing={2} pl={4}>

          <ListItem>• Generates passive income while maintaining long-term ownership of the best businesses.</ListItem>
          <ListItem>• Converts market inefficiencies into cash flow—Buffett loves “getting paid while you wait.”</ListItem>

          <ListItem>• “We love having cash when others panic.”</ListItem>
        </List>

        </List>
      </List>
      <Text mb={4}>
        <strong>What Warren Would Question:</strong>
      </Text>
      <List spacing={2} pl={4}>

          <ListItem>• Buffett hates leverage and derivatives misuse.</ListItem>

        </List>
        <ListItem>⚠ Does This Create Enduring Competitive Advantages?</ListItem>
        <List spacing={2} pl={4}>
          <ListItem>• Buffett prefers businesses that compound forever—not just extracting premium for short-term gains.</ListItem>
          <ListItem>• He would ask, “Does this strategy build long-term competitive strength or just short-term yield?”</ListItem>

      </List>
