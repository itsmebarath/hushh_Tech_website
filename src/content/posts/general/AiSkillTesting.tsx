        We live in an age of miracles. But a pre-requisite for any company to harness these miracles is that employees should be excited - and proactive - about learning how to use them.

        To test this, I’d suggest a new 2-part interview question for every candidate, whether CFO or CSR (customer service rep):

      <OrderedList spacing={2} mb={4}>
        <ListItem>How will you use AI to make your job more effective?</ListItem>
        <ListItem>What steps have you already taken to learn about AI tools in your field?</ListItem>
      </OrderedList>

      <Text mb={4}>This interview question tests for several things:</Text>

      <UnorderedList spacing={2} mb={4}>
        <ListItem>Proactively engaging with new technology rather than waiting to be trained.</ListItem>
        <ListItem>Practical understanding of AI's capabilities and limitations in their specific role.</ListItem>
        <ListItem>Viewing AI as a tool for augmentation and productivity rather than just automation.</ListItem>
        <ListItem>Insight into their learning mindset and adaptability.</ListItem>
        <ListItem>Ability to think strategically about incorporating new tools into their workflow.</ListItem>
      </UnorderedList>

        <ListItem>Realistic applications for their role, not just generic AI use cases.</ListItem>
        <ListItem>A balance between enthusiasm and pragmatism about AI's capabilities.</ListItem>
        <ListItem>Concrete examples of staying updated on AI developments in their field.</ListItem>

        <ListItem>Vague statements about AI being "the future" without specific applications.</ListItem>
        <ListItem>Only mentioning obvious tools like ChatGPT without deeper understanding.</ListItem>

        I’d suggest including this question (or even a session!) as part of every interview loop, to help identify candidates who will help your company succeed in this age of miracles. Candidates who do poorly in this question should not get an offer, even if they excel in other parts of the interview.
